I am a [Computational and Systems Biology PhD student at MIT](http://csbphd.mit.edu/) working with [Ernest Fraenkel](http://fraenkel.mit.edu/) in the department of Biological Engineering. I earned a BA in Biology and Mathematics from Bowdoin College in 2017, after which I worked under [Benjamin Ebert](https://ebertlab.dana-farber.org/) and [Gad Getz](https://www.broadinstitute.org/labs/getz] as a Computational Asssociate at the Broad Institute.

My broad research interests are in applying and developing computational methods for understanding the genetic and molecular basis for aging-associated diseases. Currently, I focus on studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease to understand the biological processes associated with genetic risk factors of neurodegeneration.
