I am a Computational and Systems Biology PhD student at MIT working with Ernest Fraenkel in the department of Biological Engineering. I earned a BA in Biology and Mathematics from Bowdoin College in 2017, after which I worked under Benjamin Ebert and Gad Getz as a Computational Asssociate at the Broad Institute.

My broad research interests are in applying and developing computational methods for understanding the genetic and molecular basis for aging-associated diseases. Currently, I focus on studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease to understand the biological processes associated with genetic risk factors of neurodegeneration.
