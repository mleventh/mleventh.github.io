Outside of research, I am enthusiastic about performing rock music and running. In 2018, I united my interest in distance running with data science by developing a computational method for predicting teams selected for Division III Cross Country nationals based on At-large bids. Below are some articles I wrote for [TrackYack]( https://trackyack.com/) detailing my method and the performance of the model in 2018:
